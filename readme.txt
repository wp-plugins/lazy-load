== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I lazy load other images in my theme? =

You can add an attribute called "data-lazy-src" with the source of the image URL and set the actual image URL to a transparent 1x1 pixel.

The alternative, and this isn't too highly recommended, is to use output buffering:

`ob_start( array( LazyLoad_Images, 'add_image_placeholders' ) );`

This will lazy load <em>all</em> your images.
